# A basic Go/No-Go test for loading backbone.subviews with browserify

## brief notes on how to set this up:
1. check out the repo
1. use npm to install dependencies in node_modules
  - browserify (installed globally)
  - backbone.subviews (seems to not install via npm!)
  - backbone, underscore, jquery 
1. execute the bundle.sh script to bundle everything up.
1. Visit the index.html page to see if it declares the load as a pass or fail.
